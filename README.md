The computer will randomly generate a letter from a-z.  The user is tasked with figuring out which letter the computer generated.  The user types in their guess and if they are right the user wins and the game starts over, if they are wrong then they lose one guess and have nine remaining attempts to get it right, the letter that they chose is displayed on the screen in a list of wrong guesses.  If the user runs out of guesses the game is over and counted as a loss.  The game will restart with a newly generated letter.
